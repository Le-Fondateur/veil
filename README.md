### Building from Source

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone the Veil repository from GitHub.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install`.
3.  **Build the Extension:** Run `npm run build` to build the extension.
4.  **Load the Extension:** Follow the manual installation steps above, using the `dist` directory as the extension directory.

## Usage Examples

This section provides examples of how to use Veil's features.

### Content Blocking

Veil automatically blocks trackers, ads, and other unwanted content. No specific action is required to enable this feature. You can verify that content is being blocked by visiting a website known for displaying ads or trackers.

### Website Security Warnings

When Veil detects a potentially malicious website, it will display a warning message in the browser.

**Example:**

If you visit a website known to distribute malware, Veil might display a warning like this:

```
Veil Security Alert: This website has been flagged as potentially malicious.
```

### Customizing Rules

You can customize the blocking rules by modifying the `rules.json` file. This allows you to block or allow specific content or websites.

**Example:**

To block all content from `example.com`, you can add the following rule to `rules.json`:

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "url_pattern": "*://example.com/*",
      "action": "block"
    }
  ]
}
```

After modifying `rules.json`, you may need to reload the extension for the changes to take effect.

### Secure DNS

To enable secure DNS, navigate to the Veil extension's popup and enable the "Use Secure DNS" option.

### HTTPS Everywhere

Veil automatically upgrades HTTP connections to HTTPS where available. No specific action is required.
